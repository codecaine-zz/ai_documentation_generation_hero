# AI Programming Documentation Generator

This application allows you to generate programming documentation using AI.

## Developer Note

I used VSCode Edit with Copilot to create title navigations for the download markdown.

**Note**: This document can run on any VSCode extension Live Server. It can also be loaded in PyWebView for Python or Neutralinojs for a desktop application.

**Note**: You can copy and paste the default prompts in VSCode with Copilot to generate different ones for any specific language. The `defaultPrompts` can be found in `index.js` in the `js` folder.

**Note**: You can use the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension to navigate the markdown easily.
